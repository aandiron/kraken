------------------------------------------------

Strange and terrifying things live in the ocean. Many of them are still
completely unknown to science. And some of those things are monsters
with voracious appetites.

In this erotic short story a marine scientist slips over the edges of
her fantasies in the darkness of 6000 feet of water. There, the limits
of her rational scientific mind are split open by an encounter with one
of the most unique, reclusive, and massively powerful creatures on Earth
- the colossal squid.

Leave conventional erotica behind, and descend with her into this world
of pitch. There will you will discover if you are among the few who can
find pleasure in the cold blackness of the deepest places - in the coils
of the Kraken.
