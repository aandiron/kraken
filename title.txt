This list isn't some vast database of contacts, it's more like a friends-and-family thing. Besides, my productivity is so low, you'll probably wish to see MORE emails from me, not fewer. Consider buying another story! Just search for A. Andiron on the Kindle Store. If everyone reading this right now paid $3, I would have like $9. But it would only take 10k people paying $3 for me to make a living doing this. (Yes I could live on that.) There probably ARE 10,000 people out of the 7 billion in the world who would be willing to pay that. It could be you! And If you support my creative project, I'll support yours! send me your link.
description: Strange and terrifying things live in the ocean. Many of them are still completely unknown to science. And some of those things are monsters with voracious appetites.  In this erotic short story a marine scientist slips over the edges of her fantasies in the darkness of 6000 feet of water. There, the limits of her rational scientific mind are split open by an encounter with one of the most unique, reclusive, and massively powerful creatures on Earth - the colossal squid.
